Tests with large input data (100 products with 26 variables) are generated using gen.py
Syntax: python3 gen.py [operation] [test number]
Example: python3 gen.py + 10
Output data: test10.txt output 10.txt

WARNING!!!: If a test with the specified number exists, it will be overwritten! Numbers 1-20 are reserved.


Two scripts are written for testing: ./testing.sh ./profiling.sh

Before use: chmod +x testing.sh
            chmod +x profiling.sh

1. Run tests: ./testing.sh
2. Run tests with MemorySanitizer: ./testing.sh memory
3. Run tests with AddressSanitizer: ./testing.sh address
4. Profiling: ./profiling.sh [test number]
